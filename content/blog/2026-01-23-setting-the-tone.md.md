It's 2026, I have spent almost 20 years in this industry and I think it's time to do something new. I'm not a tech guru so clearly I won't be writing anything novel about tech world. But I think I have enough experience to give my opinionated thought about other articles floating around. Therefore, the first theme of this blog would be reviewing other tech (and non-tech) articles. Think of it as a ... reaction blog.

The second theme I am interested in is game development. I entered this industry because I wanted to develop games. But I ended up losing my way for almost 20 years. Now, I'm quite serious about it. In the first year, it will probably be about my own journey developing my own games, starting from how I explore the tutorials and recreate my childhood games. Eventually, it should evolve into me creating my actual game that I am going to sell it somewhere.

Wish me luck. 🍀
